### Well, sure! We all do.

#### But, now you can neurotically obsess over your extreme watchtimes like never before!

7. Run the following:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 sadge_scraper.py
```

8. Sit back, relax, and eat some popcorn while YT servers shit themselves over this **super-optimized** and not totally shit script (that will probably have to run for at least 7 hours...)
